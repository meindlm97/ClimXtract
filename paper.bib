abstract = {Abstract Climate and weather simulations are challenging in mountainous regions, due to complex meteorological processes. While a kilometer-scale grid spacing significantly improves the representation of topography, little is known about the associated added value over mountains. Here we evaluate various kilometer-scale climate simulations against observations of precipitation, temperature and cloud cover over Europe, distinguishing high versus low mountains and flatland. We show that the increase in the resolution generally improves model performance, but depending on the model this added value can be larger, smaller or even absent over complex mountainous terrain. Using several models and configurations, we identify the choice of parameterizations as a possible important factor controlling mesoscale influences on mountain climate. These results suggest that the full potential of kilometer-scale simulations in regions of complex topography may not be reached yet, and call for future research to improve the remaining parameterizations like turbulence.},

abstract = {Abstract The use of regional climate model (RCM)-based projections for providing regional climate information in a research and climate service contexts is currently expanding very fast. This has been possible thanks to a considerable effort in developing comprehensive ensembles of RCM projections, especially for Europe, in the EURO-CORDEX community (Jacob et al., 2014, 2020). As of end of 2019, EURO-CORDEX has developed a set of 55 historical and scenario projections (RCP8.5) using 8 driving global climate models (GCMs) and 11 RCMs. This article presents the ensemble including its design. We target the analysis to better characterize the quality of the RCMs by providing an evaluation of these RCM simulations over a number of classical climate variables and extreme and impact-oriented indices for the period 1981–2010. For the main variables, the model simulations generally agree with observations and reanalyses. However, several systematic biases are found as well, with shared responsibilities among RCMs and GCMs: Simulations are overall too cold, too wet, and too windy compared to available observations or reanalyses. Some simulations show strong systematic biases on temperature, others on precipitation or dynamical variables, but none of the models/simulations can be defined as the best or the worst on all criteria. The article aims at supporting a proper use of these simulations within a climate services context.},

abstract = {HEALPix—the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization—is a versatile structure for the pixelization of data on the sphere. An associated library of computational algorithms and visualization software supports fast scientific applications executable directly on discretized spherical maps generated from very large volumes of astronomical data. Originally developed to address the data processing and analysis needs of the present generation of cosmic microwave background experiments (e.g., BOOMERANG, WMAP), HEALPix can be expanded to meet many of the profound challenges that will arise in confrontation with the observational output of future missions and experiments, including, e.g., Planck, Herschel, SAFIR, and the Beyond Einstein inflation probe. In this paper we consider the requirements and implementation constraints on a framework that simultaneously enables an efficient discretization with associated hierarchical indexation and fast analysis/synthesis of functions defined on the sphere. We demonstrate how these are explicitly satisfied by HEALPix.}
